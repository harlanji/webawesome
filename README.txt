This is a small project that I am building for personal use. I think it is helpful to share, but I am not going gangbusters making is usable until there is some demand for it. 

A goal is to make the project as agnostic as possible to selection of frameworks. It may also servce as an extension point to allow dropping in Go / Ruby / Python as well... because those are pretty awesome web things too.

Please let me know if you're using it and I'd love to discuss it--I am brand new to this sort of project, so I am learning as I go. That means you shouldn't consider this stable at all :).
